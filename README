Please save your logo suggestions in the image folder. Thank you! I am currently developing our site framework in Drupal and will upload it here when I have something worthy of uploading. To do this you will need to do some reading up on how to do a "fork" and a "pull request" on github. Please use your brain and google to figure this out. Think of it as a test. If you can figure it out... you can contribute.
